\begin{abstract}
We present a unified framework, the \textit{Quantum Harmony of Forces}, where the four fundamental forces — gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, and strong — are represented as distinct vibrational frequencies in a unified spacetime. At high energy levels, such as those in the early universe, these forces resonate perfectly, forming a single fundamental interaction modeled by the center of a lemniscate. As the universe evolves and energy dissipates, the forces separate into distinct interactions, symbolized by the extremities of the lemniscate. This framework offers a novel perspective on the dynamics of force unification and separation over cosmological timescales.

\section{Theorem: Quantum Harmony of Forces and Cosmic Lemniscate}

\textbf{Statement:} The universe in its fundamental state can be described as a \textit{Quantum Harmony of Forces}, where the four fundamental forces — gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, and strong — behave as distinct vibrational frequencies within a unified spacetime. At extremely high energy levels, these forces exist in perfect resonance, forming a single fundamental interaction, represented by the center of a lemniscate (∞ curve). As the universe evolves and energy decreases, the forces differentiate into distinct interactions, symbolized by the extremities of the lemniscate.

\section{1. Unification of Forces at High Energy}

At the beginning of the universe, at energy levels comparable to the Big Bang, all fundamental forces were unified. This suggests that the frequencies associated with these forces were in phase, creating a coherent and unique interaction. Mathematically, this is modeled as a state of perfect resonance where the forces act as a unified harmonic vibration in a single unified space.

\section{2. Separation of Forces at Lower Energy}

As the universe expands and energy decreases, the vibrational frequencies of each force begin to desynchronize. This bifurcation leads to the separation of the fundamental forces we observe today. Their respective frequencies can be thought of as distinct "notes" in the cosmic symphony, each playing a crucial role in the evolution and structure of the universe.

\section{3. Mathematical Formulation}

The evolution of this unification and separation of forces can be described by a unifying equation that represents the forces as vibrational oscillators. Let \( \mathcal{F} \) be the unified interaction of the forces, and \( A_i \) the amplitude of each differentiated force. The behavior of these forces over time can be formulated as:

\[
\Psi(\mathcal{F}, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{4} A_i e^{i\omega_i t}
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \mathcal{F} \) represents the unified force at the initial moment,
    \item \( A_i \) represents the amplitude of each separated force,
    \item \( \omega_i \) is the frequency associated with each force (gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, strong),
    \item \( t \) is time.
\end{itemize}

\section{4. Dynamic Theory and Reunification}

The lemniscate represents a dynamic model where the forces oscillate between phases of unification and separation throughout the evolution of the universe. At certain energy scales or timescales, it is theoretically possible that these forces could rejoin, creating a new unified state before differentiating again. This cyclical process is represented by the cosmic lemniscate.

\section{5. Cosmic Integration of Forces}

The conceptual formula describing the unification and separation of forces is given by the following integral:

\[
U = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Psi(\mathcal{F}, t) \, dt
\]

Where \( U \) represents the universe as the sum of unified and differentiated interactions over time. This formulation integrates the idea that the universe, in its entirety, is the result of a continuous cycle of unification and separation of force frequencies, evolving within a cosmic lemniscate.

\section{Conclusion}

This theorem presents a unified vision of the fundamental forces, based on a vibrational analogy and dynamic symmetry represented by a lemniscate. It offers a new perspective on how the forces of nature interact and differentiate within the context of cosmic evolution. This \textit{Quantum Harmony of Forces} could provide a theoretical framework for unifying the physical laws at high energy scales and exploring new cosmological dimensions.
